# Mirubato Architecture Design

## Overview

Mirubato is a comprehensive music education platform built on Cloudflare's edge infrastructure, designed to help musicians improve their sight-reading skills and track their practice journey. The platform combines sophisticated practice tracking, sheet music management, and advanced analytics with real-time synchronization across devices.

## UI Component Architecture (v1.8.0)

Mirubato uses a two-layer UI component architecture for maximum reusability:

### Package Structure

```
@mirubato/ui (packages/ui/)     # Shared, pure UI components
├── Autocomplete, Button, Card, Modal, Input, Select, Toast
├── Typography (MusicTitle, MusicComposer, MusicMetadata)
├── Loading, SegmentedControl, Tabs, Tag, TimePicker
└── Utilities: cn(), formatDuration()

frontendv2/src/components/ui/   # App-specific components with business logic
├── EntryDetailPanel           # Logbook entry details
├── CompactEntryRow            # Compact entry display
├── ToastProvider              # Toast state management
├── ProtectedButton            # Click protection with hooks
└── index.ts                   # Barrel re-exporting @mirubato/ui
```

### Design Principles

1. **Pure Components in Package**: `@mirubato/ui` contains only stateless, reusable UI components with no business logic or app-specific dependencies.

2. **Business Logic in App**: Components that depend on stores, hooks, or app state stay in `frontendv2/src/components/ui/`.

3. **Single Import Path**: All UI components are imported from `@/components/ui` which re-exports both package and app-specific components.

4. **Named Exports Only**: All components use named exports for better tree-shaking and explicit imports.

### Import Convention

```tsx
// All UI imports go through the barrel export
import { Button, Modal, MusicTitle, ProtectedButton } from '@/components/ui'
import type { ButtonProps, SelectOption } from '@/components/ui'
```

### Typography System

Music-specific typography uses Noto Serif for excellent multilingual support:

- `<MusicTitle>` - Piece titles
- `<MusicComposer>` - Composer names
- `<MusicMetadata>` - Opus numbers, catalog info

General UI uses Inter (body) and Lexend (headers).
